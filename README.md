* Although the minimum temperature in December is 15 degrees lower than the average, 75% of the temperature is much warmer, as evident by the fact that the 25th percentile is 69 degrees.

# Summary
As seen by the results, the establishment of the shop is recommended as the average temperarture does not vary too much over the year. Even the colder temperature is at a point where people will still surf and/or go out for activities, which means the business will still thrive even during winter months since the difference in the temprature drop is just few degrees.
